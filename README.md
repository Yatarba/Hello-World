# Hello World 👋

Welcome to my first GitHub project! 🚀  
I created this repository to practice and learn the basics of GitHub — how to create a repo, make commits, and share my work.

## 🌱 What to Expect
- Simple test files and practice code
- Updates as I learn more
- A space to grow my coding journey

## 🛠️ Goals
- Learn how to use Git and GitHub
- Understand version control
- Build confidence in sharing projects

## ✨ Stay Tuned
I’ll be adding more soon. This is just the beginning. 💪❤️
